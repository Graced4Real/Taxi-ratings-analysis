Dataset from Quantum Analytics NG
Project Tittle: NYC Taxi Project:
This dataset contains 6 tables in csv format. The 4 Taxi Trips tables contain a total of 28 million Green Taxi trips in New York City from 2017 to 2020. Each record represents one trip, with fields containing details about the pick-up/drop-off times and locations, distances, fares, passengers, and more . The 454 Calendar table contains a fiscal calendar (2017-2020) used by the Taxi & Limousine Commission, with fields containing the date and fiscal year, quarter, month, and week . The Taxi Zones table contains information about 265 zone locations in New York City, including the location id, borough, and service zones.
The aim of this analysis was to answer the following:
1. What's the average number of trips in a week? 
2. What's the average fare per trip? 
3. What's the average distance traveled per trip? 
4. How do we expect trip volume to change, relative to last week? 
5. Which days of the week and times of the day will be busiest? 
6. What will likely be the most popular pick-up locations?
